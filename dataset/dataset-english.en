I hope I can have my own exhibition.
One day.
I like to write poetry.
Weaving words into beauty.
Expressing what is in my heart.
Sometimes about love.
Sometimes about life.
Sometimes about nature.
Poetry is a play on words.
Rhyme and rhythm that make it melodious.
It can be free or bound by rules.
Not everyone can understand it.
But the important thing is that I can be honest.
With my own feelings.
Through writing.
I want to publish a book of poetry.
So that other people can read it.
And maybe, feel what I feel.
I like to cook.
Trying new recipes.
Combining spices.
Making delicious food.
Cooking is like an art.
It requires creativity and patience.
I like baking cakes the most.
The smell is fragrant when it's baked.
It makes the house feel warm.
Seeing other people enjoy my cooking.
Is the greatest happiness.
I started a small catering business.
From home.
I hope it can grow.
To become a successful restaurant.
I like to exercise.
Especially badminton.
I can play with my friends.
Breaking a sweat.
It makes the body healthy and fit.
The mind also becomes fresh.
Exercise is an investment for the future.
To stay healthy in old age.
Let's get moving.
Don't just sit all day.
Walk, run, or cycle.
Choose a sport you like.
To be consistent.
I enjoy gardening.
Planting vegetables and flowers.
In the yard.
Watching a seed grow into a plant.
Is an amazing process.
Watered and fertilized every day.
Waiting until it can be harvested.
It feels very happy.
To be able to eat vegetables from your own garden.
Healthier and fresher.
Gardening teaches me patience.
And to respect the process.
Everything takes time.
Nothing is instant.
I participate in volunteer activities.
Helping at an orphanage.
Tutoring the children.
And playing with them.
Seeing their smiles makes my heart happy.
I feel useful.
Giving is more joyful than receiving.
It doesn't have to be material.
Time and energy are also very valuable.
Let's care about our surroundings.
Help those in need.
Make the world a better place.
Even from small things.
I like to daydream.
Imagining various things.
If I could fly.
If I had superpowers.
If I could turn back time.
Daydreaming is okay.
It can stimulate creativity.
But don't forget reality.
We must keep our feet on the ground.
And face life.
Daydreaming is entertainment.
Reality is a struggle.
Balance them both.
I am afraid of cockroaches.
I will run if I see one.
I am also afraid of the dark.
I have to sleep with a dim light on.
Everyone has fears.
It's normal.
The important thing is how we handle them.
Don't let fear control our lives.
Face those fears.
Little by little.
Until we can overcome them.
I like the morning sun.
It's warm and gives spirit.
I don't like hot weather.
It makes the body sticky and lazy.
I like drizzling rain.
It's romantic and calming.
I don't like heavy rain with wind.
It's scary and can cause floods.
Every weather has its good and bad sides.
Like life.
Sometimes sunny, sometimes cloudy.
Just enjoy it.
Because after the rain, there is always a rainbow.
I believe in fate.
But I also believe in effort.
We must try our best.
Surrender the results to God.
Fate and effort must go hand in hand.
Don't just surrender without effort.
Or make an effort without prayer.
Everything must be balanced.
I have done my best.
The rest is no longer my business.
I am at peace.
I am learning to forgive.
Forgiving others who have hurt me.
And forgiving myself.
For the mistakes I have made.
Forgiving is not easy.
But it is necessary.
So the heart can be at peace.
Resentment is like poison.
That destroys from within.
Let's let it go.
And start a new chapter.
Life is lighter without burdens.
I am learning to be sincere.
Accepting realities that cannot be changed.
Letting go of what is not mine.
Sincerity is the highest level of patience.
The heart becomes spacious.
Not easily complaining.
And always grateful.
I am still learning.
It's a long process.
But I am sure I can do it.
Life is the best school.
The teacher is experience.
The exam is problems.
The report card is wisdom.
Let's be good students.
Who always learn and grow.
Until the end of life.

I couldn't bear the thought of it.
Let's keep an eye on that.
Could you let them know it will be a few more minutes?
I see he's still asleep.
Everything looks great.
He's going to be very weak and peaky for the next couple of days.
I'll be back to check on him before I head out today.
No need to introduce yourself.
I'm so pleased you could make it.
We're all big fans of your music around here.
We're glad this all worked out so well.
Do her parents know she was selected for the program?
You can blame that on me.
We weren't expecting you this early.
There's really no need to introduce Tom, is there?
There wasn't much I wanted to take with me.
Looks like there's a storm coming in.
How often do I get asked out on a date?
Tom is relatively my age and he's a singer.
That doesn't happen every day.
Do you think he expects you to sleep with him?
I'm going to let you go.
Did I come at a good time?
I hope you didn't have any trouble finding the place.
Are you thinking of making a career out of it?
I try to keep as low a profile as possible.
I avoid those things like the plague!
They just want to sell papers.
There's no way to please everyone in this industry.
I know my music isn't for everyone.

He is very knowledgeable on the subject.
He may be powerful, but he is not invincible.
He is a great analyst and a great parliamentarian.

I believe we should be giving a positive message.
I think we did a pretty good job.
This is moving in the wrong direction.
I think this meets a social need.
I believe that the debate should be carried on.
I think that puts an end to the debate.
I do not think that requires much comment.
I believe it would disrupt the balance.
I think that this meeting will be a big step forward.
I think we have heard enough on this.
I think this debate is getting close to the level of the absurd.
I think the consequences are fairly significant.
I think the government has to get it straight.
I think we are sending the wrong message to Canadians.
I think that our bill is realistic.
